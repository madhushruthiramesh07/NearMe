                The Madras High Court, located in Chennai, is one of the oldest and 
                most prestigious high courts in India. Established in 1862, 
                it has jurisdiction over the state of Tamil Nadu and the Union
                Territory of Puducherry. The court is known for its impressive architecture, 
                blending Indo-Saracenic and Gothic styles. It plays a crucial role in the Indian judicial system, 
                handling a wide range of civil and criminal cases, and has been instrumental in shaping legal precedents in the country.
